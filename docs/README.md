# Documentation

Extended documentation for backlog-mcp that doesn't belong in CLAUDE.md.

## Contents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | System design and data flow |
| [patterns.md](patterns.md) | Task execution patterns (Ralph Loop, OODA, ReAct) |

## Why Separate from CLAUDE.md?

CLAUDE.md contains essential context loaded every session. These docs are:
- Reference material (not needed every session)
- Detailed specifications
- Research notes
- Historical decisions
